This spring term course is designed for graduate (or advanced undergraduate) students and research scientists with an interest in how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques can be used to provide information of value to biological scientists and physicians. The course will introduce basic NMR theory, including spectroscopic and relaxation phenomena. Examples of biochemical data obtained using NMR will be summarized, along with other, related experiments. The course will then focus on imaging with NMR, and include discussions of basic cross sectional image reconstruction, image contrast, flow and real time imaging, and microscopy.
